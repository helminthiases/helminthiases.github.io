# Introductory Notes
{: .fs-9 }

Predicting the prevalence of geohelminths infections
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The pages of helminthiases.github.io complement the project's **(a)** code repositories,  and **(b)** its accompanying 
thesis, the latter is in progress.

### Project Aim

> Understanding the association between STH (Soil Transmitted Helminth) prevalence and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) variables,
> and their effect, or otherwise, on STH prevalence prediction.

<br>

### Project Objectives

Hence, the project's objectives are to

> * Understand the association between STH (Soil Transmitted Helminth) prevalence and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) variables
>
> * Determine the extent to which WASH variables aid STH prevalence prediction via geostatistical models.
