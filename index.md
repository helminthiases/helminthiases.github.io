#### **Project Aim**
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 30px">
Understanding the association between STH (Soil Transmitted Helminth) prevalence and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) variables,
and their effect, or otherwise, on STH prevalence prediction.</p>


#### **Project Objectives**
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px">
Hence, the project's objectives are to</p>
* Understand the association between STH (Soil Transmitted Helminth) prevalence and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) variables
* Determine the extent to which WASH variables aid STH prevalence prediction via geostatistical models.
